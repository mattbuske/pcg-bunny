# The Search-Based Approach to Procedural Content Generation - PCG Bunnies!
 
This project demonstrates the [search-based approach](http://pcgbook.com/wp-content/uploads/chapter02.pdf) to procedural content generation utilizing evolutionary search algorithms (See the [PCG Book](https://pcgbook.com) for more info on procedural content generation and other approaches). This project evolves bunnies over a number of generations to achieve bunnies with desired traits.
