# The Search-Based Approach to Procedural Content Generation - PCG Bunnies!

## Introduction

Welcome to the PCG Bunnies repository! This project showcases the application of search-based procedural content generation using evolutionary algorithms. The goal of this project is to generate bunnies with specific desirable traits through the evolution process.

## Key Features
- Demonstrates the implementation of search-based PCG using evolutionary algorithms
- Produces bunnies with specific desirable traits through the evolution process
- Provides a comprehensive understanding of the concepts of PCG and its different approaches

## Documentation

For a more in-depth understanding of the project and its implementation, refer to the [full documentation](https://mattbuske.github.io/pcg-bunny/). For a general understanding of procedural content generation and its various approaches, the PCG Book (https://pcgbook.com) is a great resource.
