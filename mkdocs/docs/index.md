# The Search-Based Approach to Procedural Content Generation - PCG Bunnies!
 
 The purpose of this software project is to showcase the application of <a href="http://pcgbook.com/wp-content/uploads/chapter02.pdf" target="_blank">search-based procedural content generation</a> through the use of evolutionary search algorithms. This approach is a widely recognized method in the field of procedural content generation and is discussed in depth in the book <a href="https://pcgbook.com" target="_blank">"The PCG Book"</a>.

The project focuses on evolving bunnies over multiple generations with the goal of obtaining bunnies with specific, desired traits.
