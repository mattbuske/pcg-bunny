# The Search-Based Approach to Procedural Content Generation - PCG Bunnies!

## Introduction

Welcome to the PCG Bunnies documentation! This project showcases the application of search-based procedural content generation using evolutionary algorithms. The goal of this project is to generate bunnies with specific desirable traits through the process of evolution. For a general understanding of the concept of procedural content generation and its various approaches, the PCG Book [https://pcgbook.com](https://pcgbook.com) is a great resource.

The project was originally developed during the spring of 2014 at SUNY Oswego using the C++ programming language. Since then it has been built in a few different languages and better documentation has been added.

## Key Features
- Demonstrates the implementation of search-based PCG using evolutionary algorithms
- Produces bunnies with specific desirable traits through the evolution process
- Provides a comprehensive understanding of the concepts of PCG and its different approaches
